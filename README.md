# RoutingProtocols

Implemented link state and distance vector routing protocols. Original graph is a 4 node graph where link costs between nodes x and y will be denoted as x -> y (cost)
The costs of the graph are 0 -> 1 (1), 0 -> 2 (1), 1 -> 3 (7), 1 -> 2 (10), 2 -> 3 (2).
Both link state and distance vector are implemented using this graph. 
Implementation in Project3.java files for both link state and distance vector.
